# easm (E100 Assembly Syntax support)

This extension is used to support E100 syntax and is based off of Alex House's [Sublime Text addon](https://github.com/ahouse101/SublimeE100Assembly).
This also takes inspiration from an [LC2K addon](https://github.com/mookie1097/lc2k) by mookie1097 for the hover info.

## Installation

Currently, the only way to install the plugin is to clone the repository and run `vsce package` to get an VSIX file and install that manually. I may put this package on the VSCode Marketplace at some point.
